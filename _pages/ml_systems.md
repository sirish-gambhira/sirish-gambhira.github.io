Here's a list of papers in the machine-learning and systems domains that I implemented from scratch and their corresponding code respositories.

1. "Attention is all you need" [[code](https://github.com/sirish-gambhira/attention-pytorch)]: Implemented and trained a Transformer (encoder-decoder) architecture for neural machine translation task between english (source) to italian (target) using [opus_books](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/opus_books) dataset.

I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and a researcher at [SAIL Lab](https://gatech-sysml.github.io/). I am interested in MLSys and have been working on GPU programming, KV cache optimizations for disaggregated LLM inference, serving systems for quantized models. I interned at AMD quantization in Summer'25 where I developed multi-gpu solutions to speedup expert-quantization for MoE models using GPTQ and model evaluation pipelines.

Prior to Georgia Tech, I worked as a Research Engineer (2022-2024) at Microsoft Research India with [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/) and contributed to [HyWay](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hyway/). I co-led HyWay from a research concept into internal product and built enhanced user interfaces. I built cool end-to-end systems such as indoor user localization and continual learning for user-state modeling. I completed my bachelors and masters (integrated) in Electronics from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India (2022) with a focus on 3D computer vision.

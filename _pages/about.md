I am a graduate student in Computer Science department at Georgia Tech and a student-researcher at [SAIL Lab](https://gatech-sysml.github.io/) with Payman Behnam and [Prof. Alexey Tumanov](https://gatech-sysml.github.io/members/alexey-tumanov.html). Prior to Georgia Tech, I worked as a Research Engineer (2022-2024) at Microsoft Research India with [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/) and contributed to [HyWay](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hyway/). I applied machine learning algorithms to novel use-cases such as indoor localization and multi-sensor based user-state modeling. I completed my bachelors and masters (integrated) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India (2022) with a focus on 3D computer vision. My current interests lie in the intersection of systems and machine learning.

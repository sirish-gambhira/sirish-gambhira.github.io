### Using Deep Learning to pre-process Electrophysiology Data

- Implemented a sequential Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) network to learn a mapping from raw EEG data to clean EEG data
- Explored loss functions like MSE, KL Divergence, Gaussian Negative Log Likelihood to capture the target data
- Performed an ablation study to understand the roles of RNN, VAE components 
- Implemented [EEG quality assessment metrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231217300048) to quantify the goodness of the EEG signals

### Highlights
- Top 5 theses nominated for Best Thesis

### 3D Object Reconstruction using multi-view 2D images
- Implemented an encoder-decoder architecture to generate independent 3D point clouds from each multi-view image and fused
them into a unified 3D point cloud object.
- Extracted 2D key points from the generated 3D objects for supervision, eliminating the need for labelled 3D ground truth.
- Obtained a Chamfer distance of 5.12, comparable to the state-of-the-art single-view reconstruction result of 3.48.

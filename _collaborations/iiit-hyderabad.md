### Skeletal Human Activity Recognition

- Recognized human activities from skeleton representations using Hierarchical Deep Learning models
- Studied architectures like Hierarchical Deep CNN, Network of Experts, Deep Mixture Of Experts via Shallow
Embedding, to improve validation accuracy on NTU 120 data-set by clustering similar classes
- Implemented Network of Experts architecture, a hierarchical deep learning architecture in PyTorch
- Fine-tuned model along with 5 experts with overall soft-max loss yielded a validation accuracy of **84.28%**
